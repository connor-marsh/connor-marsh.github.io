# Welcome to my portfolio website!
### This site is currently being developed so there is more content/projects to come
In my first-year at the University of Pittsburgh I took a project based class called ***The Art of Making***, in which we made websites for the four main projects we did in the class. Since I already have existing websites for those projects I'll link them here as a starting point, but in the future I'll make more pages for my personal projects and projects from other classes.
###### Art of Making project links:
* <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/garagehand/home" target="_blank">Wearable Piano Gloves</a>
* <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/the-washcup-system/" target="_blank">Automatic Recycling Station</a>
* <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/autodogfeeder/home" target="_blank">IoT Dog Feeder App</a>
* <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/humangamecontroller/home" target="_blank">Wearable Video Game Controller</a>

I also have some other projects that act as standalone websites so I'll link those here
###### Standalone website links:
* <a href="https://connor-marsh.github.io/Chess" target="_blank">Chess with AI Opponent</a>
* <a href="https://connor-marsh.github.io/FracturedIdentity" target="_blank">Videogame I made from scratch (custom engine) for a gamedev competition</a>

###### Here is how I'll have my other projects included in this website once I get to it:
* <a href="Project1.html">Sample project page (empty)</a>
