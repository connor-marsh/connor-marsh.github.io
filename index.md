# Welcome to my portfolio website!
### This site is currently being developed so there is more content/projects to come
In my first-year at the University of Pittsburgh I took a project based class called ***The Art of Making***, in which we made websites for the four main projects we did in the class. So I'll link those projects here as a starting point, but in the future I'll make more pages for my personal projects and projects from other classes.
