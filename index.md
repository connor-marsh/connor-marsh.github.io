# Welcome to my portfolio website!
###### This site is currently being developed so there is more content/projects to come (I'm busy with engineering school, and these projects)

## Featured Projects:
#### Rubiks Cube Solving Robot

<a href="https://github.com/connor-marsh/RubiksBot" target="_blank">Github Page (ReadMe)</a>

#### Bop-It! Zelda Replica Sword
This one is a little hard to describe. Basically we made a replica of a sword from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, that plays like a Bop-It!  
The page is quite empty at the moment but I'll update it with all the media soon

#### Robot Arms
I'm the project leader for the Pitt Robotics and Automation Society Robot Arms Project. I lead a team of five students in developing diverse robotic arm applications. Our current projects include building a bio-mimetic hand, building a new six-axis arm from the ground up, making one of our existing arms play chess, and making one of our existing arms be able to bounce a ping pong ball. I manage task distribution, mentor team members, and contribute directly to each project. One of our successful projects last semester was establishing control of an arm using computer vision and ML tracking a human’s arm joints. This was accomplished using Google’s media-pipe model and OpenCV. We presented this project at the city of Pittsburgh’s annual robotics convention.

These pages are somewhat outdated and we have more recent work that I haven't added to the pages yet

## Other Projects
#### Art of Making Projects:
In my first-year at the University of Pittsburgh I took a project based class called ***The Art of Making***, in which we made websites for the four main projects we did in the class. Since I already have existing websites for those projects I'll link them here as a starting point, but in the future I'll make more pages for my personal projects and projects from other classes.

I have some projects that act as standalone websites so I'll link those here
